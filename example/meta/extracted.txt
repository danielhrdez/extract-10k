1CFO Outlook Commentary
We e xpect first quarter 2025 total revenue to be in the range of $39.5-41.8 billion. This reflects 8-15% year-over-year 
growth, or 11-18% growth on a constant currency basis as our guidance assumes foreign currency is an approximately 3% 
headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates. This also reflects the effect of lapping leap 
day in the first quarter of 2024. While we are not providing a full year 2025 revenue outlook, we expect the investments we 
are making in our core business this year will give us an opportunity to continue delivering strong revenue growth throughout 
2025.
We expect full year 2025 total expenses to be in the range of $114-119 billion. We expect the single largest driver of expense 
growth in 2025 to be infrastructure costs, driven by higher operating expenses and depreciation (1). We expect employee 
compensation to be the second-largest factor as we add technical talent in the priority areas of infrastructure, monetization, 
Reality Labs, generative artificial intelligence (AI), as well as regulation and compliance.
We anticipate our full year 2025 capital expenditures will be in the range of $60-65 billion. We expect capital expenditures 
growth in 2025 will be driven by increased investment to support both our generative AI efforts and core business. The 
majority of our capital expenditures in 2025 will continue to be directed to our core business.
Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full year 2025 tax rate to be in the range of 12-15%.
In addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and 
the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.
____________________________________
(1) In January 2025, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of certain servers and network assets, which resulted in an increase in 
their estimated useful life to 5.5 years, effective beginning fiscal year 2025. Based on the servers and network assets placed in service as of 
December 31, 2024, we expect this change in accounting estimate will reduce our full year 2025 depreciation expense by approximately 
$2.9 billion. This is factored into our outlook.

3Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding our future business plans and expectations. These forward-
looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the 
impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our 
ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals 
and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-
party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as 
well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on 
community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our 
brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; 
competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell 
advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or 
developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-
dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential 
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the 
caption "Risk Factors" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on October 31, 2024, which is available on 
our Investor Relations website at  investor.atmeta.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will 
also be set forth in our Annual  Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. In addition, please note that the 
date of this press release is January 29, 2025, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions 
that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new 
information or future events.
For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled "Limitations 
of Key Metrics and Other Data" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: 
revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The 
presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, 
financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material 
limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be 
different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. 
We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these 
non-GAAP financial measures.
We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial 
performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary 
independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in 
operating our business. 
Our non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items: 
Foreign exchange effect on revenue . We translated revenue for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2024  
using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we 
believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.
Purchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases.  We subtract both purchases of property and 
equipment, and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two 
items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of 
whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful 
supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended 
to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. 
For more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please 
see the "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results" table in this press release.
